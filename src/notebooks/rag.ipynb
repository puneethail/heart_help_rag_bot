As such, only a few procedures fulﬁ ll these criteria: \\nligation/division/occlusion of a patent ductus arteriosus and \\nclosure of an isolated secundum atrial septal defect. Other inter-\\nventions or surgical procedures may result in repair or “correc-\\ntion,” however not necessarily in normal hemodynamics or life \\nexpectancy. In fact, some assume limitation in cardiovascular \\nreserve and the need for close follow-up, further medical man-\\nagement, and potential or additional surgical therapies. In other \\ncases, as in children with palliated CHD, the circulation may still \\nbe abnormal. Th ese individuals have been reported to be at a \\ngreater risk of adverse perioperative events.333-335\\nTh e eﬀ ect or impact to the heart and other systems during \\nprevious procedures also requires careful consideration. A \\nnumber of problems may remain or develop after surgical inter-\\nvention. Th ese include residual shunts, valvar stenoses or \\noutﬂ ow tract obstruction, valvar regurgitation, pulmonary \\nhypertension, arrhythmias, and ventricular dysfunction. Chil-\\ndren who require a detailed appraisal of perioperative risks \\ninclude those with residual signiﬁ cant pathology; suspected or \\nknown pulmonary hypertension, single-ventricle physiology \\n(including patients post Norwood procedures, Glenn opera-\\ntions, or Fontan palliations), and after conduit placement or \\ncardiac transplantation (see Chapters 15, 16, and 21).\\nSummary\\nCaring for children with heart disease is a major aspect of \\npediatric anesthesia practice. Th e spectrum of pathology in \\nthe pediatric age group includes a wide range of structural \\ndefects as well as varied acquired diseases. Th e ability to provide \\noptimal care is dependent on an understanding of the basic \\npathophysiology of the lesions; familiarity with the commonly \\nused diagnostic modalities and their clinical applications; \\nand medical and surgical treatment options available to aﬀ ected \\nindividuals. In this chapter we have presented basic concepts \\nin cardiology that may enhance the overall knowledge of \\nthe practicing anesthesiologist in pediatric cardiovascular \\ndisease.\\nAnnotated References\\nHata T, Todd MM: Cervical spine considerations when anesthetiz-\\ning patients with Down syndrome.

       "  'A QTc that exceeds 460  msec is considered abnormal regard-\\nless of age. All QTc values that exceed normal values for age \\nmerit further investigation. Medications that prolong the QT \\ninterval should be avoided until the child has been evaluated by \\na cardiologist.\\nAlthough a detailed organized approach to pediatric ECG \\ninterpretation is necessary, there are occasions when particular \\nconditions or circumstances cause global ECG changes that \\nmust be quickly recognized. One such case that may occur in \\nthe operating room relates to the ECG changes associated with \\nhyperkalemia. As the potassium level rises, the T-wave ampli-\\ntude will increase. Th is is followed by widening of the QRS \\nduration (Fig. 14-16) due to an intraventricular conduction \\ndelay and, ﬁ nally, atrioventricular block and arrhythmias, \\nincluding ventricular tachycardia and ﬁ brillation.

       "[['Conditions and Disorders \\nWhat are the common conditions and disorders that affect your \\nheart? \\nHeart conditions are among the most common types of disorders. In the United States, heart \\ndisease is the leading cause of death. \\nCommon conditions that affect your heart include: \\n• \\nArrhythmia: A heartbeat that’s too fast, too slow or beats with an irregular rhythm. \\n• \\nCardiomyopathy: Unusual thickening, enlargement or stiffening of your heart \\nmuscle. \\n• \\nCongestive heart failure: Your heart is too stiff or too weak to properly pump blood \\nthroughout your body. \\n• \\nCoronary artery disease: Plaque buildup that leads to narrow coronary arteries. \\n• \\nDiabetes: Your blood sugar is higher than it should be. \\n• \\nHeart attack (myocardial infarction): A sudden coronary artery blockage that cuts off \\noxygen to part of your heart muscle. \\n• \\nHeart valve disease: A valve in your heart isn’t working right. \\n• \\nHigh blood pressure: Your blood is pushing too hard against your artery walls. \\n•',\n",
